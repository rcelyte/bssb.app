## Development

### Live deployment
Successful builds on this repository's `main` branch will be automatically deployed to the live site at https://bssb.app.

### Goals
My goal for this project is to keep it fast and lean. It primarily just passes information back and forth, so there's no need for any complex architecture. There's some specific goals I set for this project:

- Minimal code
- Minimal dependencies
- Cache everything

Bottom line: I want to be able to continue to run this on a $5 droplet.
